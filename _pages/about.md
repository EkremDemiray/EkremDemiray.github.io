I am a highly motivated researcher with a deep and evolving interest in both theoretical and applied physics. My academic path began at Istanbul Technical University, where I pursued dual degrees in Physics Engineering and Electronics and Communication Engineering. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I consistently maintained high academic standing, supported by the Vehbi Koç Foundation Scholarship and multiple appearances on the Dean’s High Honor List. Currently, I am continuing my academic journey as a Ph.D. student in Physics at the University of Florida, supported by the prestigious Grinter Fellowship. My graduate work focuses on higher-order Hamiltonian truncation in effective field theory, and I have been fortunate to work closely with Dr. Rachel Houtz in exploring the subtleties of loop calculations, code optimization, and software design for theoretical physics applications.

Beyond the classroom and research lab, I have actively sought out interdisciplinary experience. Over the years, I have worked on a range of projects spanning quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, scalar and tensorial perturbations on primordial black holes, and the singularity structures of exotic black hole geometries, using both symbolic computation and advanced mathematical formalisms like the Newman–Penrose framework. At the same time, I have also engaged in hands-on engineering projects—designing radon detectors, working with infrared imaging systems, and contributing to embedded systems development in aerospace applications. My professional experience includes roles at Baykar Technologies, Navio, and Turkish Aerospace Industries, where I developed real-time software, optimized machine learning algorithms, and contributed to flight-critical embedded systems on platforms such as Hürjet and Gökbey.

I take pride in my versatility, combining a strong command of programming languages (including Python, C++, Maple, and LaTeX) with a solid foundation in advanced mathematics and theoretical physics. My exposure to a wide range of tools—from TRIM/SRIM simulations and Poisson Superfish to modern software environments like Git, Docker, and CMake—has allowed me to adapt quickly and contribute effectively across diverse domains. I have also participated in numerous workshops and summer schools, including programs at DESY and the Feza Gürsey Institute, which have helped me stay connected with cutting-edge research and an international academic community. As I continue to grow as a physicist and engineer, I am driven by curiosity, a commitment to rigorous problem-solving, and a desire to bridge the gap between theory and practical innovation.
